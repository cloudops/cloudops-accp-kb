The CloudMC Web user interface is designed to easily align with your corporate branding.  Brand management in CloudMC allows an Operator, a Reseller, or someone with the *Branding: Manage* permission to:
   - Override the default colours for the interface
   - Select the available and default languages
   - Change the logo on the login page, in the side menu, and the favicon
   - Define the application name presented by the browser

Each organization can apply its own branding, and a **default branding** can be created for all organizations if desired.

Additionally, advanced users can apply custom CSS settings to modify the appearance of specific user interface components.  This article does not cover advanced mode.
