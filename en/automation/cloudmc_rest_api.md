This article introduces the CloudMC REST API, and provides details on how to access it.

## Detailed overview

As an API-driven orchestration platform, CloudMC provides access to all functionality via its REST API. Any feature that is accessible via the Web user interface can be accessed via the API. All calls to the API are secured via HTTPS connections and with an API key that is unique to your account.

## API key and endpoint

In order to use the CloudMC API, you will start by logging into the system and creating an API key for your requests. The following article provides the steps on creating a new API key:

In addition to the API keys, the **API credentials** page will also list the URL to use when connecting to an endpoint.
