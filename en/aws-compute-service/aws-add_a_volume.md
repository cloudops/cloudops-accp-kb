In this example, we will add a new volume to the Acme `production` AWS environment. We will add a general purpose 10GB volume to the `us-east-1b` availability zone, and automatically attach it to our instance `acme-prod-db01`.

### Before you begin

-   The Acme `production` environment must already exist
-   The instance `acme-prod-db01` must already exist in the `us-east-1b` availability zone

    2.  Select `General Purpose SSD (gp2)` for the volume type.

    3.  Enter `10` into the **Size** text box.

    4.  Select the `us-east-1b` availability zone.

5.  We will configure the new volume to be attached to our instance:

    1.  Click on **Attach volume to existing instance**.

    2.  Select `acme-prod-db01` from the list of instances.

    3.  Enter `/dev/sdf` into the text box labeled **Device Name**.

6.  Click the **Submit** button.


### Results

-   Our new volume `acme-prod-vol01` of 10GB is created in the Acme `production` environment
